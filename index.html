            <h2>Space</h2>
            <p>Space, the final frontier, has captivated human imagination for centuries. It is a vast and enigmatic expanse that stretches beyond our planet, shrouded in mystery and wonder. From the glittering stars that adorn the night sky to the infinite cosmic realms that beckon us to explore, space is a realm of boundless potential and discovery.</p>
            <p>In the cold vacuum of space, celestial bodies dance to the rhythms of gravity. Planets orbit their parent stars, moons encircle their worlds, and galaxies spiral in cosmic waltzes. Black holes, those enigmatic cosmic abysses, devour everything in their path, while supernovae unleash titanic explosions that forge new elements.</p>
            <p>Humanity's journey into space has been marked by both triumphs and challenges. The iconic first steps on the Moon, taken by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, stand as a testament to human determination and exploration. Space telescopes like the Hubble have unveiled the wonders of the universe, from distant galaxies to the birth of stars.

        <h2>Rating Job</h2>
        <p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After hitting a record low in July, President Joe Biden's job approval rating is up six percentage points to 44%, his highest in a year. While this uptick represents a significant improvement on the heels of several policy successes for Biden, he still remains underwater overall, with 53% of Americans disapproving of his job performance.</p>

        <p> The increase in Biden's job rating is largely buoyed by political independents, whose approval rose from 31% last month to the current 40%. Democrats' (81%) and Republicans' (4%) ratings of Biden are not significantly changed over the same period. </p>

        <p>These findings are from an Aug. 1-23 Gallup poll, which spanned an eventful period in Biden's presidency. While recovering from COVID-19, the president announced the U.S. had killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri. In the days following, congressional Democrats passed Biden's sweeping domestic spending plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, a healthcare, climate and tax package. </p>

                <h3>IC 1101</h3>
                <p>To date, the biggest galaxy that has been discovered is IC 1101. IC 1101 is classified as a supergiant elliptical galaxy, and it looks far different than the Milky Way. As an elliptical galaxy, IC 1101 contains an abundance of low to medium mass red and yellow stars, most of which are quite old. At the center of IC 1101, there exists a supermassive black hole, which happens to be the largest black hole ever discovered. IC 1101 has an estimated diameter of four million light-years. In comparison, the Milky Way is roughly 100,000 light-years in diameter, making IC 1101, 40 times larger than the Milky Way. If you were to place IC 1101 where the Milky Way is, it would completely engulf the Andromeda Galaxy at 2.5 million light-years away. IC 1101 is located roughly one billion light-years away from the Milky Way and likely contains over 100 trillion stars. </p>

                <h3>Hercules A</h3>
                <p>The elliptical galaxy designated as Hercules A is the second-largest galaxy known to exist. Hercules A has an estimated diameter of 1.5 million light-years, and like IC 1101, it is classified as a supergiant elliptical galaxy. Other than its size and galaxy type, not much is known about Hercules A, and there is a reason for this. The supermassive black hole at the center of Hercules A is currently emitting two gigantic beams of radio waves. These beams are so energetic that they make it difficult to study the rest of the galaxy in detail. Even these beams of radio waves are gigantic, measuring over one million light-years in length.</p>

                <h3>A2261-BCG</h3>
                <p>A2261-BCG is the third-largest known galaxy in the universe, having a diameter of one million light-years, roughly ten times the size of the Milky Way. A2261-BCG is a supergiant elliptical galaxy and is estimated to contain over ten trillion stars. A2261-BCG is a rather strange galaxy for one simple fact: it does not contain a supermassive black hole at its center. The vast majority of large galaxies in the universe have a supermassive black hole at their center, yet for unknown reasons, A2261-BCG does not. A2261-BCG is located three billion light-years away from us. </p>

                    <h3>Sérgio Sacani</h3>
                    <p>Sérgio is popularly known as a YouTube science popularizer and astronomy enthusiast. Sérgio has been interested in astronomy since he was little, when he lived in Viçosa and in mid-1986, when there was much talk about the passage of Halley's Comet, his interest in astronomy began to blossom.

                        In June 2009, Sacani created the Cientec blog: a blog that provided information and scientific articles that supported news and firm and validated opinions on the topics. Sérgio Sacani continued with his blog, Cientec, for years, until the website underwent changes and rebranding, becoming Space Today, whose name is a tribute to two famous astronomy blogs, Universe Today and Space .with.
                       
                        On April 9, 2015, the Space Today channel was created on YouTube, with more than one million subscribers and with an exclusive focus on astronomy topics, and a blog of the same name. On its interview channel created in 2021, Ciência Sem End, made at the Flow Podcast studios, he interviews people who also work or like Science, Technology and Education topics.</p>
